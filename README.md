Synopsis:

The project aims at creaƟng a mobile applicaƟon that is able to visually represent the 
working of operaƟng system algorithms for process scheduling, process synchronisaƟon,
deadlock detecƟon and prevenƟon, disk scheduling, etc. The visual representaƟon will be in 
the form of animaƟon and charts. The user will be able to create custom problems, choose 
from a set of default problems that highlight edge cases or randomly generate a problem on 
which the OS algorithm will work. The user can submit their own soluƟon to the problem 
and compare the results with the automaƟcally generated answer.
